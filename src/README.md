# Deploy structure
Deploy directory can be specified in Shape build script `build*.bat` resp. `buildMake.sh` or is defaulted to `.../shape/deploy`. The directory is passed to dependent projects via cmake variables during configuration/generation phase.

The deploy directory is created by cmake install by build script and it can be re-run by INSTALL target in MSVC, resp. `make install`

The deploy directory contains ready to run installation and tests. It can be used by a packaging script. Note we intend to evaluate cmake packaging feature even for packaging if applicable.
