# Software design


## 1 Component design

Software design is based on [Shape](https://github.com/logimic/shape) component framework.
The framework itself is just a glue to put all components together. However it allows flexible adding of other features or redesign existing.  The business logic itself is implemented in components described in this document.
The framework is described in: [Shape/README.md](https://github.com/logimic/shape/blob/master/README.md). It follows basic principals as defines by these terms used in next text

**Module** is distributable software in form of shared library. Includes components data classes and logically merges related SW parts.

**Interface** is pure virtual (abstract) class containing methods (functions). Used parameters should be general not exposing implementation details.

**Component** is class which implements Interface. There can be more components implementing the same Interface. E.g. component logging to file and component logging into database. Both can implement the same Interface. Component may use other Interfaces implemented by other Components.

**Component Instance** is an object of a component created by the component constructor. Number of created Component Instances depends on an application configuration. E.g. file logging component can have three instances, one for critical errors, second for debug level and third for a specific component.

**Provided Interface** is running Component Instance implementing the Interface published to be used.

**Required Interface** is published placeholder for required Interface. If a Component Instance wants to use an Interface it publish the placeholder.

**Attach Interface** is delivering Provided Interface to Required Interface placeholder.

**Detach Interface** is withdrawal of Provided Interface to Required Interface placeholder.

**Interface Cardinality** is SINGLE or MULTIPLE. It means Required Interface instance can be attached just once or all instantiated Interfaces can be attached.

**Interface Optionality** is UNREQUIRED or MANDATORY. It means all MANDATORY Interfaces have to be attached.

**Interface Target** is UNREQUIRED or MANDATORY. It means all MANDATORY Interfaces have to be attached.

**Activate** is a Component Instance state when all MANDATORY Required Interfaces were attached and the instance is set by Shape to normal operation.

**Dectivate** is a Component Instance state when some of MANDATORY Required Interface was detached and the instance is set by Shape to stop normal operation.

**Service** is represented by its Interface. Provides service like doing command, send data, parse data, calculate data, registering call-back, etc. Service is a published Interface (Provided or Required) within Shape framework.


## 2 Interfaces & Components with respect to JSON API

Description of components processing messages received/sent via JSON API

![ComponentDiagramWrtJsonAPI.png](sw-design-resources/ComponentDiagramWrtJsonAPI.png)

### Interfaces
#### IMessagingService
Is abstraction of specific messaging protocol
- send message (address, message)
- register/unregister message handler (handlerId, handleFunction)
- get messaging ID name (string) 
- handleFunction(address, message)
- get flag if accepts async DPA message

#### IMessagingSplitterService
Is abstraction of messaging splitter. Incoming message is preparsed and the message is routed to proper handler according registered message type filters. When a message (response) is sent an implementation has to assure that it is routed back to proper messaging according messagingId 
- send message (messagingId, message)
- register/unregister message handler (vector< message filter>, handleFunction)
- handleFunction(messagingId, address, message) 


### Components
#### WebsocketMessaging

#### JsonSplitter
It uses Required Interface IMessagingService to register a handler processing incoming request messages. JsonSplitter preparses the request messages to get a message type controlling where to route the next processing. It implements IMessagingSplitterService. A users of the interface is selected by matching the type and registered filters. The filter match if it is substring of incoming message type. It the type fits registered handler of the user is called. When the processing is finished the user sends back a response message. The response message is send according messagingId parameter.

## 3 Interfaces & Components with respect to DPA

Description of components acting in processing of DPA messages 

![ComponentDiagramWrtIqrfDpa.png](sw-design-resources/ComponentDiagramWrtIqrfDpa.png)

### Interfaces
#### IIqrfDpaService
Is abstraction of IqrfDpa Component (DPA Transaction, timing, error evaluation, etc.)
- execute Dpa Transaction
- get/set Dpa Transaction default timeout
- get/set RF mode (std/lp)
- register/unregister async message handler

#### IIqrfChannelService
Is abstraction of device driver providing connection to IQRF Coordinator
- send message
- get accessor with receive handler with normal, exclusive, sniffer access mode (for SW download/upload, for IDE4 cooperation)
- get state (ready, not ready, exclusive access)

### Components

#### BaseService
Processes legacy daemon V1 Raw and RawHdp messages, convert them to DPA messages and executes DPA transaction via IIqrfDpaService interface.
 
#### JsonDpaApiIqrfStandard
Processes Standard and Embed devices handling JSON API messges, convert them to DPA messages and executes DPA transaction via IIqrfDpaService interface.


#### JsonDpaApiRaw
Processes Raw and RawHdp JSON API messges, convert them to DPA messages and executes DPA transaction via IIqrfDpaService interface.

#### LocalBondService
TODO

#### OtaUploadService
TODO

#### ReadTrConfigService
TODO

#### SmartConnectService
TODO

#### WriteConfigService
TODO

#### Ide4Counterpart
TODO

#### IqrfDpa
Encapsulates DPA transaction processing via clibdpa and IIqrfChannelService as a channel to the coordinator

#### IqrfCdc
Implements IIqrfChannelService via CDC

#### IqrfSpi

TODO: There shall be dedicated Component providing processing of asynchronous DPA messages. It is expected these messages could be send offen from asynchronous events from sleeping sensors (e.g. door open). I seems appropriate to analyze content and use right JS script to translate from DPA binary representation to user friendly format

#### SchedulerMessaging
This component is responsible for handling requests messages to schedule tasks. The messages are in form of requests messages as it would be sent directly but wrapped in a scheduling envelope controlling postponing, periodicity, etc. JsonSched uses IScheduler interface to schedule the tasks. When it is fired by Scheduler JsonSched uses Provided Interface IMessaging to send wrapped request message via JsonHub to dedicated message handling component.
