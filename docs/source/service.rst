Use the power of `IQRF IDE`_ and its IQMESH Network Manager to control your network. Connection 
to the gateway is via UDP channel.

Mode change
-----------

IQRF Gateway Webapp (/gateway/change-mode/) can be used to switch the gateway into **service** mode.
Mode switching can be also done via `management API`_.
